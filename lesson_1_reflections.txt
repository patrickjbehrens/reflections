I'm really just doing this to practice using this text editor.
The course instructors suggested I use Sublime, but that costs $70.
So I chose Atom, which is free, and is built by Github, and appears to possibly
be more advanced than when they created the course.
So they can suck it.
Oh, and I did "Install Shell Commands", which now allows me to use Atom from
the terminal.

'Commit' allows you to save a version of the code, so you can go back to it if
necessary. This is a manual process (though I assume the software is saving
changes you make along the way). The benefits of manual saving is that it
gives you control to 'commit' at logical break points.

git log - This is used to pull up a repository e.g "git log asteroids.git"
git diff - This is used to find changes from one commit to the next, using
   the commit id's.
